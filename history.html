    <p id='paragraph'>Water. It is an essential for human survival and something that always surrounds us. However, clean water, clean enough to drink at least, is so scarce around the world that millions of people die every year. Without a stable water supply, especially a clean water supply, humans won’t even be able to survive, much less learn, innovate, and create a sustainable environment. Luckily, many people do live in a region with a stable clean water supply that allows them to be sure they will always have access to safe drinking water. However, this isn’t true in many places around the world, mainly developing countries, and even a few places in the United States. In these developing countries and areas clean water scarcity has been a issue for a pretty long time, and is mainly due to outdated, failing infrastructure and a corrupt or powerless government that is either unwilling or unable to fix the infrastructure that would provide the country with a steady supply of clean water. Recently, however, the greatest issue that makes it almost impossible for people in developing countries to have stable supply of clean water is overpopulation. Natural disasters like the hurricane that crippled Haiti on november 8th, 2013 can be a huge issue, but with so many aid groups worldwide and the relative rarity of such events the overall effects of these disasters are greatly diminishing. Yet there is one issue that will continue to grow in effect and is commonly forgotten about, and that issue is overpopulation. For example, India has the second greatest population in the world, with 1,351,457,837 people, and is affected greatly by water scarcity, not just clean water scarcity, but normal water scarcity. If India had a population closer the United states, which by the way is about a fourth of its population, it would probably be at a much better position in terms of water scarcity and be able to provide clean water to most of the country. In fact, India has infrastructure that is failing so badly that the whole country will run out of water in twenty years. All of it. If that happens, India is as good as gone. Water is an essential for human beings, something we can’t even survive without, and if we don’t have a steady access to clean water, our future as a species will be dark and won’t have the light of innovation, freedom, and possibly survival.</p>
