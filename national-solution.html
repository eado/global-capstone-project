    <p id="paragraph">Some countries have money to spend on water-based infrastructure like pipes, dams, and reservoirs but choose not to. These countries would be evaluated and the UN would be able to choose to withhold a portion of the funds and support going to that country unless the country relents and spends the money on water infrastructure. However, this wouldn’t help countries that don’t have money to begin with, but the UN could provide them with funds. Countries could just refuse to improve their water infrastructure. Also, countries could lie about their spending on water infrastructure. Poor water-based infrastructure is a big roadblock to fresh water availability in many countries, including the US. Some of these countries, especially the US, have money available but do not spend it on their infrastructure. These countries would have greatly improved quality of life if they began spending money on infrastructure. The people in that type of country would be much happier.</p>
